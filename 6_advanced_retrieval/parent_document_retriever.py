            "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers "
            "to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. The field was "
            "revolutionized in 2012 when AlexNet won the ImageNet competition by a wide margin, "
            "demonstrating the power of convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs. Deep learning "
            "models learn hierarchical representations: lower layers capture simple features like edges "
            "and colors, while deeper layers capture complex abstractions like faces or objects.\n\n"
            "The fundamental building block is the artificial neuron, which computes a weighted sum of "
            "its inputs, adds a bias term, and applies a non-linear activation function such as ReLU, "
            "sigmoid, or tanh. Layers of neurons are stacked to form deep networks capable of "
            "approximating any continuous function, as guaranteed by the universal approximation theorem.\n\n"
            "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized architectures for grid-like data such "
            "as images. They use convolutional filters that slide across the input, sharing parameters "
            "across spatial locations to efficiently learn spatial hierarchies of features. Pooling "
            "layers reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important features. Modern CNN "
            "architectures like ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet have achieved human-level performance on "
            "image classification tasks.\n\n"
            "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data. They maintain a hidden "
            "state that captures information from previous time steps, enabling them to model temporal "

            "Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) address this by using "
            "gating mechanisms that selectively remember and forget information across many time steps.\n\n"
            "The Transformer architecture, introduced in Attention Is All You Need (2017), revolutionized "
            "deep learning by replacing recurrence with self-attention mechanisms. Self-attention computes "
            "relationships between all pairs of positions in a sequence in parallel, capturing long-range "
